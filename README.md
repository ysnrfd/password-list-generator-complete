## üöÄ Overview

**PLG_ysnrfd** is a powerful tool for **password security analysis** and **context-aware password generation**.  
It leverages advanced algorithms for entropy calculation, pattern recognition, user behavior modeling, and cultural context to produce **strong, personalized passwords** and evaluate the strength of existing ones.

This project is designed to improve cybersecurity awareness and is intended **only for authorized security testing and educational purposes**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Comprehensive Password Analysis**  
  Detects dictionary words, keyboard patterns, repeated characters, cultural references, and common password structures.

- **Entropy Calculation**  
  Calculates the password entropy based on Shannon‚Äôs formula and penalizes weak or predictable patterns.

- **Smart Password Generation**  
  Creates personalized passwords using user information (e.g., names, pets, dates, cultural events) with advanced transformations (leet-speak, camelCase, hex encoding, etc.).

- **Multi-Language Support**  
  Supports **English, German, Persian, French, and Spanish** with language-specific wordlists and keyboard layouts.

- **Ethical Safeguard System**  
  Built-in interactive verification to ensure usage is legal and ethical (authorized penetration testing).

- **Behavioral Prediction**  
  Uses a `UserBehaviorPredictor` class to understand the security awareness, emotional bias, and cultural context of the user.

- **Encrypted Logging**  
  Secure logging of usage data with SHA-256 hashing.

- **Leaked Password Transformation**  
  Learns from compromised passwords and generates improved, stronger variants.

Edit
from PLG_ysnrfd import ContextualPasswordGenerator

user_info = {
    'first_name': 'Alice',
    'birth_year': '1995',
    'pets': ['Luna'],
    'nationality': 'USA',
    'language': 'en'
}

generator = ContextualPasswordGenerator(language='en')
passwords = generator._generate_weighted_combinations(user_info, count=10, min_length=8, max_length=16)
print(passwords)

üß† Algorithms
Entropy Calculation
Uses Shannon entropy, keyboard pattern detection, and character frequency analysis to assess password complexity.

User Behavior Modeling
Predicts password habits based on cultural background, age, pets, children, and emotional factors.

Context-Aware Password Generation
Combines personal data, cultural events, and randomized transformations to produce strong, unique passwords.

üìä Roadmap
 Web-based interface (Streamlit/Flask)

 Integration with leaked password databases (HaveIBeenPwned API)

 AI-based password strength recommendation system

 More language packs (Italian, Russian, Arabic)

 Plugin-based architecture for custom rules
